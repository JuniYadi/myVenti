Analyze and fix theme switching functionality\n  - File: hooks/use-color-scheme.ts and app/_layout.tsx\n  - Investigate why theme toggle is not working properly\n  - Fix theme persistence and automatic detection\n  - Purpose: Ensure dark/light theme switching works correctly\n  - _Leverage: existing useColorScheme hook, theme provider, AsyncStorage_\n  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native Theme Specialist with expertise in React context and AsyncStorage | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Debug and fix the theme switching functionality by analyzing the use-color-scheme.ts hook and theme provider in _layout.tsx, ensuring theme toggle works, preferences persist across restarts, and all components reflect theme changes correctly. | Restrictions: Do not modify existing theme color definitions, maintain backward compatibility, ensure theme switching works across iOS, Android, and Web platforms | Success: Theme toggle works immediately, preferences persist after app restart, all UI components reflect theme changes correctly, automatic system theme detection functions properly_\n\n- [ ] 2. Implement compact card layout for home screen\n  - File: app/(tabs)/index.tsx and constants/theme.ts\n  - Reduce card padding and optimize layout for better space utilization\n  - Maintain readability while making cards more compact\n  - Purpose: Fit more information at a glance with smaller summary cards\n  - _Leverage: existing card styling system, ThemedView/ThemedText components_\n  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3, 2.4_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native UI/UX Developer specializing in layout optimization and responsive design | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Optimize the summary cards layout in app/(tabs)/index.tsx to be more compact by reducing padding and spacing while maintaining readability, leveraging existing theme constants and ThemedView/ThemedText components for consistent styling. | Restrictions: Do not modify card data structure or functionality, maintain accessibility touch targets (minimum 44x44 points), preserve existing color scheme and content hierarchy | Success: Cards display with more compact layout, content remains readable and properly aligned, visual hierarchy is maintained, layout efficiently uses screen space_\n\n- [ ] 3. Add form error boundaries and stability improvements\n  - File: components/forms/ and create new error boundary component\n  - Implement React Error Boundaries for form components\n  - Add comprehensive error handling and recovery mechanisms\n  - Purpose: Prevent app crashes when forms encounter errors\n  - _Leverage: existing form validation patterns, error alert system_\n  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4, 3.5_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native Error Handling Specialist with expertise in React Error Boundaries and form validation | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Create form error boundaries and comprehensive error handling for all form components to prevent app crashes, provide graceful error recovery, and ensure forms remain stable during rendering, submission, and validation failures. | Restrictions: Do not modify existing form validation logic, maintain current form structure and data flow, preserve user input when possible during error recovery | Success: Forms display without freezing, submission errors are handled gracefully with user feedback, validation errors show clear messages, app remains stable during unexpected errors, form components initialize properly_\n\n- [ ] 4. Remove unimplemented location tracking from settings\n  - File: app/(tabs)/settings.tsx\n  - Remove location tracking options and related navigation items\n  - Clean up settings page to show only functional features\n  - Purpose: Eliminate confusing non-functional settings options\n  - _Leverage: existing settings page structure and navigation system_\n  - _Requirements: 4.1, 4.2, 4.3, 4.4_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native Settings UI Specialist with expertise in component cleanup and navigation | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Remove all location tracking related options from the settings page and navigation menu, ensuring only functional and implemented features remain visible to users while maintaining clean UI and proper navigation flow. | Restrictions: Do not modify functional settings options, maintain existing settings page structure and styling, preserve navigation to other settings sections | Success: Settings page displays only functional options, all location tracking references removed from navigation, remaining settings work correctly, UI is clean and uncluttered_\n\n- [ ] 5. Test and validate theme switching across all components\n  - File: All modified components and theme system\n  - Verify theme switching works correctly across all fixed components\n  - Test theme persistence and system detection\n  - Purpose: Ensure consistent theme behavior across the application\n  - _Leverage: existing theme testing patterns and component structure_\n  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2, 1.3, 1.4_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native QA Engineer with expertise in theme system testing and validation | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Comprehensively test theme switching functionality across all modified components to ensure consistent behavior, proper theme persistence, and correct reflection of theme changes in all UI elements. | Restrictions: Do not modify component functionality during testing, focus on validation and documentation of any issues found, ensure testing covers both light and dark themes | Success: All components reflect theme changes correctly, theme preferences persist properly, automatic system theme detection works, no visual inconsistencies or missing theme updates in any component_\n\n- [ ] 6. Perform comprehensive integration testing\n  - File: All modified files and components\n  - Test all bug fixes working together as a cohesive system\n  - Validate user workflows and app stability\n  - Purpose: Ensure all fixes work correctly without breaking existing functionality\n  - _Leverage: existing app functionality and user interaction patterns_\n  - _Requirements: All requirements_\n  - _Prompt: Role: Senior React Native QA Engineer with expertise in integration testing and user experience validation | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Perform comprehensive integration testing of all bug fixes together, validating that theme switching, compact cards, form stability, and settings cleanup work cohesively without breaking existing app functionality or user workflows. | Restrictions: Do not modify core app functionality during testing, document any integration issues found, ensure all user workflows remain functional, validate app stability under normal usage patterns | Success: All bug fixes work together correctly, existing functionality remains intact, app is stable and responsive, user experience is improved without regressions, no new issues introduced by the fixes_",
