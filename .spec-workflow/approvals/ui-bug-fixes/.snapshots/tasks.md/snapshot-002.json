Extend theme constants with compact card sizing\n  - File: constants/theme.ts\n  - Add new spacing constants for compact card layouts\n  - Define optimized dimensions for summary and quick action cards\n  - Purpose: Establish consistent sizing system for all card optimizations\n  - _Leverage: existing Spacing, Typography, and color constants in theme.ts_\n  - _Requirements: 1.1, 3.1_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native UI/UX Developer specializing in theme systems and responsive design | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Add new theme constants for compact card layouts including cardCompact and quickActionCompact spacing definitions, maintaining consistency with existing design system while optimizing for better space utilization on mobile screens. | Restrictions: Do not modify existing theme constants, maintain naming conventions, ensure new constants work with both light and dark themes | Success: New theme constants integrate seamlessly with existing theme system, provide appropriate sizing for compact layouts, maintain visual hierarchy and accessibility standards_\n\n- [ ] 2. Optimize summary cards layout and sizing\n  - File: app/(tabs)/index.tsx\n  - Modify summary card component styling to use compact dimensions\n  - Reduce padding, margins, and minimum height from 120px to 90px\n  - Purpose: Improve space utilization on home screen while maintaining readability\n  - _Leverage: existing card grid layout, ThemedView component, color system_\n  - _Requirements: 1.1, 1.2_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native Component Developer with expertise in responsive layouts and UI optimization | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Refactor the summary cards section in app/(tabs)/index.tsx to use compact sizing, reducing card height from 120px to 90px while maintaining the 2x2 grid layout and all existing functionality including data binding, colors, icons, and indicators. | Restrictions: Do not modify card data structure, maintain responsive behavior, preserve accessibility features and touch targets, keep existing color scheme and icon usage | Success: Summary cards display properly with reduced dimensions, maintain visual balance, all content remains readable and accessible, layout adapts correctly to different screen sizes_\n\n- [ ] 3. Convert quick actions to single row layout\n  - File: app/(tabs)/index.tsx\n  - Change quick action grid from 2x2 to 1x4 horizontal layout\n  - Implement horizontal scrolling for smaller screens if needed\n  - Purpose: Optimize vertical space usage while keeping all quick actions accessible\n  - _Leverage: existing quick action card components, navigation routing, icon system_\n  - _Requirements: 3.1, 3.2, 3.3_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native Layout Engineer with expertise in responsive grids and touch interfaces | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Convert the quick actions section from 2x2 grid to single horizontal row layout in app/(tabs)/index.tsx, ensuring all 4 actions remain accessible with proper navigation routing and maintaining minimum 44dp touch targets for accessibility. | Restrictions: Do not change navigation routes or functionality, maintain accessibility standards, ensure cards remain tappable on all screen sizes, preserve existing icon and color scheme | Success: Quick actions display in single row with proper spacing, horizontal navigation works if needed, all actions remain accessible and functional, layout maintains visual consistency_\n\n- [ ] 4. Fix bottom navigation Home button highlight alignment\n  - File: components/navigation/circular-home-button.tsx\n  - Adjust highlight ring positioning to center perfectly on the Home icon\n  - Optimize ring size relative to button dimensions\n  - Purpose: Provide precise visual feedback for active navigation state\n  - _Leverage: existing circular button component, haptic feedback, theme animations_\n  - _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_\n  - _Prompt: Role: React Native Navigation Specialist with expertise in UI animations and visual feedback | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Fix the Home button highlight ring alignment in components/navigation/circular-home-button.tsx to ensure the circular indicator is perfectly centered around the icon with appropriate sizing relative to the button dimensions. | Restrictions: Do not modify tab navigation functionality, preserve haptic feedback and animations, maintain accessibility features, ensure consistent behavior across active/inactive states | Success: Highlight ring centers perfectly on Home icon, visual feedback is clear and precise, navigation functionality remains intact, animations and haptic feedback work as expected_\n\n- [ ] 5. Verify responsive behavior and accessibility compliance\n  - File: app/(tabs)/index.tsx and components/navigation/\n  - Test all changes on different screen sizes and orientations\n  - Ensure 44dp minimum touch targets are maintained throughout\n  - Purpose: Validate that all UI improvements work correctly across all devices\n  - _Leverage: existing responsive design patterns, accessibility testing tools_\n  - _Requirements: All functional and usability requirements_\n  - _Prompt: Role: QA Engineer with expertise in mobile accessibility and responsive testing | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Perform comprehensive testing of all UI changes across different screen sizes, orientations, and accessibility requirements, ensuring touch targets meet 44dp minimum standards and layouts remain functional and visually balanced. | Restrictions: Do not modify core functionality, focus on validation and testing, document any issues found, ensure all components remain usable | Success: All UI changes work correctly across different devices and screen sizes, accessibility standards are met, touch targets are properly sized, visual consistency is maintained_\n\n- [ ] 6. Test theme switching and visual consistency\n  - File: constants/theme.ts and modified component files\n  - Verify all changes work correctly in both light and dark themes\n  - Ensure color system integration is maintained across all components\n  - Purpose: Validate theme compatibility and visual consistency\n  - _Leverage: existing theme switching mechanism, color system_\n  - _Requirements: All non-functional requirements_\n  - _Prompt: Role: Frontend QA Specialist with expertise in theme systems and visual testing | Task: Implement the task for spec ui-bug-fixes, first run spec-workflow-guide to get the workflow guide then implement the task: Test theme switching functionality thoroughly to ensure all UI optimizations work correctly in both light and dark themes, maintaining proper color contrast and visual hierarchy throughout the application. | Restrictions: Do not modify theme switching logic, focus on validation and consistency checks, document any theme-related issues found | Success: All UI components render correctly in both themes, color contrast meets accessibility standards, visual hierarchy is maintained, no theme-related visual artifacts or inconsistencies exist_",
