These fixes will improve space utilization, visual alignment, and overall interface polish to create a more professional and user-friendly experience.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThese UI improvements support the myVenti app's goal of providing a clean, efficient, and intuitive interface for vehicle management. By fixing layout issues, we ensure users have a better experience accessing key vehicle information and actions, which is essential for user adoption and satisfaction.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Optimized Card Sizing for Mobile View\n\n**User Story:** As a mobile user, I want appropriately sized dashboard cards so that I can see more content without excessive empty space.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view the home screen on mobile THEN the dashboard cards SHALL have reduced padding and height\n2. WHEN the cards are displayed THEN they SHALL maintain readability while using screen space more efficiently\n3. WHEN content is displayed THEN the cards SHALL appear proportional to the content they contain\n4. IF the screen size is small THEN the cards SHALL automatically adjust to smaller dimensions\n\n### Requirement 2: Proper Bottom Navigation Icon Alignment\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want navigation highlights to be perfectly centered on their respective icons so that I have clear visual feedback about which section is active.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I select a bottom tab THEN the circular highlight SHALL be perfectly centered around the icon\n2. WHEN the Home button is active THEN the highlight circle SHALL be appropriately sized relative to the icon\n3. WHEN any tab is selected THEN the alignment SHALL be consistent across all bottom navigation items\n4. WHEN the highlight appears THEN it SHALL not extend beyond the icon boundaries significantly\n\n### Requirement 3: Efficient Quick Action Card Layout\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want quick action cards to be compact and arranged efficiently so that I can access key actions without excessive scrolling.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view the Quick Actions section THEN the cards SHALL be smaller and more compact\n2. WHEN the cards are displayed THEN they SHALL be arranged in a single horizontal row on mobile\n3. WHEN I interact with quick actions THEN all four actions (Add Fuel, Schedule Service, etc.) SHALL remain accessible\n4. IF the screen width is limited THEN the cards SHALL be appropriately sized to fit in one row\n5. WHEN quick action cards are tapped THEN they SHALL maintain proper touch target sizes for accessibility\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each UI component should handle a specific layout concern\n- **Modular Design**: Card styling should be reusable across different sections\n- **Dependency Management**: Layout fixes should not break existing functionality\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Component props should allow for flexible sizing configurations\n\n### Performance\n- **Render Performance**: Layout changes should not impact app startup or navigation performance\n- **Memory Efficiency**: Reduced card sizes should improve memory usage on lower-end devices\n- **Smooth Animations**: Any transitions should maintain 60fps performance\n\n### Usability\n- **Accessibility**: All interactive elements must maintain minimum 44dp touch targets\n- **Visual Hierarchy**: Improvements should enhance, not reduce, content readability\n- **Consistency**: Design patterns should follow existing app conventions\n- **Responsive Design**: Fixes must work across different screen sizes and orientations",
