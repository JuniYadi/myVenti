The fixes focus on theme switching functionality, UI component sizing, form stability, and settings page cleanup. These improvements are essential for providing a stable and user-friendly experience that meets modern mobile app standards in 2025.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThese bug fixes directly support the myVenti app's core mission to provide a seamless, reliable user experience across all platforms (iOS, Android, Web). By addressing theme switching, form stability, and UI consistency, we ensure the app delivers on its promise of a polished, professional interface that adapts to user preferences and maintains stability during common interactions.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1 - Theme Switching Functionality\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want the dark/light theme toggle to work correctly so that I can use the app in my preferred visual environment.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user taps the theme toggle THEN the system SHALL immediately switch between dark and light themes\n2. WHEN theme is changed THEN the system SHALL persist the theme preference across app restarts\n3. WHEN system theme changes THEN the system SHALL respect the automatic theme detection setting\n4. IF theme toggle is available THEN all UI components SHALL reflect the selected theme colors consistently\n\n### Requirement 2 - Compact Card Layout\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want summary cards on the home screen to be more compact so that I can view more information at a glance without excessive scrolling.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN displaying summary cards THEN the system SHALL use a more compact layout with reduced padding\n2. WHEN cards are displayed THEN the system SHALL maintain readability while reducing vertical space\n3. IF multiple cards exist THEN they SHALL be efficiently positioned to maximize screen real estate\n4. WHEN content is rendered THEN it SHALL remain legible and properly aligned within the compact format\n\n### Requirement 3 - Form Stability and Error Handling\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want all forms to work reliably without causing the app to freeze or crash so that I can complete my tasks without interruption.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN any form is rendered THEN the system SHALL display the form interface without freezing\n2. WHEN form submission fails THEN the system SHALL show appropriate error messages without crashing\n3. WHEN validation errors occur THEN the system SHALL display clear feedback to the user\n4. IF unexpected errors happen THEN the system SHALL gracefully handle them and maintain app stability\n5. WHEN form components load THEN they SHALL properly initialize with all necessary event handlers\n\n### Requirement 4 - Settings Page Cleanup\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want the settings page to only show relevant options so that I can easily manage available app features without confusion.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN settings page loads THEN the system SHALL remove location tracking options that are not implemented\n2. WHEN settings are displayed THEN only functional features SHALL be shown to users\n3. IF location tracking is referenced in navigation THEN it SHALL be removed from all relevant menu items\n4. WHEN user interacts with remaining settings THEN all options SHALL be fully functional\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each bug fix should be isolated to specific components without affecting unrelated functionality\n- **Modular Design**: Theme switching logic should be centralized and reusable across components\n- **Dependency Management**: Form error handling should not introduce circular dependencies\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Theme context should provide a clean API for components to consume theme state\n\n### Performance\n- Theme switching should complete within 100ms for perceived responsiveness\n- Form rendering should not block the UI thread for more than 16ms (60fps)\n- Memory usage should remain stable during theme switches and form interactions\n\n### Security\n- Form validation should sanitize all user inputs\n- Theme preferences should be stored securely using platform-appropriate storage mechanisms\n\n### Reliability\n- Theme switching should work consistently across iOS, Android, and Web platforms\n- Forms should handle network failures and invalid data gracefully\n- App should not crash under any normal user interaction scenarios\n\n### Usability\n- Theme changes should provide visual feedback during the transition\n- Form error messages should be clear, concise, and actionable\n- UI components should maintain accessibility standards in both themes\n- Compact card layouts should maintain touch target accessibility (minimum 44x44 points)",
