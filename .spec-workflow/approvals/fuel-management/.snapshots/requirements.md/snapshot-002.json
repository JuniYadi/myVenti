The system will allow users to track fuel consumption, calculate fuel efficiency metrics, and maintain a complete history of fuel-related expenses and vehicle performance data. The fuel management system is a core component of the vehicle tracking ecosystem, providing essential data for cost analysis, maintenance planning, and environmental impact assessment.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThe fuel management system directly supports the myVenti product goal of providing a comprehensive vehicle management solution. By enabling users to track fuel efficiency and costs, this feature delivers tangible value through:\n\n- **Cost Savings**: Users can identify fuel-inefficient driving patterns and optimize fuel consumption\n- **Vehicle Health Monitoring**: Regular fuel tracking helps identify potential maintenance issues\n- **Environmental Awareness**: CO2 emissions tracking supports eco-friendly driving decisions\n- **Financial Planning**: Historical fuel data enables accurate budget forecasting\n- **Performance Analytics**: Comprehensive metrics support informed vehicle purchasing decisions\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1: Fuel Entry Creation and Management\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to record fuel entries with detailed information including date, gallons, price, and location, so that I can track my fuel expenses and consumption patterns.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I access the fuel management interface THEN the system SHALL display a prominent \"Add Fuel Entry\" action\n2. WHEN I initiate a fuel entry THEN the system SHALL present a form with fields for date, gallons/liters, price per gallon, total cost, odometer reading, and fuel station location\n3. WHEN I submit valid fuel entry data THEN the system SHALL save the entry and associate it with the selected vehicle\n4. WHEN I view the fuel entry form THEN the system SHALL pre-populate today's date and the vehicle's current odometer reading if available\n5. WHEN I provide partial fuel information THEN the system SHALL validate required fields (date, quantity, price, vehicle) before saving\n\n### Requirement 2: Fuel Entry Viewing and History\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to view all my fuel entries in a chronological list with sorting and filtering options, so that I can analyze my fuel consumption patterns and track expenses over time.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I access the fuel management screen THEN the system SHALL display all fuel entries sorted by date (newest first)\n2. WHEN I view fuel entries THEN each entry SHALL show date, quantity, price per unit, total cost, odometer, miles per gallon (MPG), and fuel station\n3. WHEN I want to find specific entries THEN the system SHALL provide search functionality by fuel station, date range, or price range\n4. WHEN I view fuel data THEN the system SHALL calculate and display fuel efficiency metrics (MPG/L per 100km)\n5. WHEN I select a specific time period THEN the system SHALL show summary statistics including total fuel consumed, total cost, and average fuel efficiency\n\n### Requirement 3: Fuel Entry Editing and Updating\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to edit existing fuel entries to correct data entry errors, so that my fuel records remain accurate and reliable for tracking purposes.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I access a fuel entry from the list THEN the system SHALL provide an \"Edit\" action\n2. WHEN I modify fuel entry data THEN the system SHALL update all related calculations (total cost, fuel efficiency metrics)\n3. WHEN I save edited fuel data THEN the system SHALL maintain the original creation timestamp but update the modification timestamp\n4. WHEN I edit historical fuel data THEN the system SHALL recalculate affected vehicle statistics and fuel efficiency trends\n5. WHEN validation fails during editing THEN the system SHALL display specific error messages and prevent saving until corrected\n\n### Requirement 4: Fuel Entry Deletion and Data Management\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to delete fuel entries when they contain errors or are no longer relevant, so that my fuel data remains clean and accurate for analysis.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I select a fuel entry THEN the system SHALL provide a \"Delete\" option with confirmation dialog\n2. WHEN I confirm deletion THEN the system SHALL remove the entry and update all affected statistics\n3. WHEN I delete fuel entries THEN the system SHALL ask for confirmation about related data impact\n4. WHEN multiple entries are selected THEN the system SHALL support batch deletion operations\n5. WHEN important historical data might be deleted THEN the system SHALL provide warnings about the impact on fuel efficiency trends\n\n### Requirement 5: Fuel Efficiency Analytics and Reporting\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to view fuel efficiency analytics and cost trends, so that I can make informed decisions about driving habits and vehicle maintenance.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN I view fuel analytics THEN the system SHALL display fuel efficiency trends over time with visual graphs\n2. WHEN I compare fuel efficiency THEN the system SHALL calculate and display MPG/L per 100km for different time periods\n3. WHEN I analyze costs THEN the system SHALL show fuel expense trends and cost per mile calculations\n4. WHEN I want detailed insights THEN the system SHALL provide fuel consumption patterns by day of week, month, or season\n5. WHEN I view multiple vehicles THEN the system SHALL allow comparison of fuel efficiency between different vehicles\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Fuel form components should handle only form presentation and validation\n- **Modular Design**: Fuel services should be isolated and reusable across different vehicle types\n- **Dependency Management**: Fuel management should depend on existing VehicleService for vehicle data\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between fuel forms, services, and data storage\n\n### Performance\n- **Fast Data Loading**: Fuel entries should load within 200ms regardless of dataset size\n- **Efficient Calculations**: Fuel efficiency metrics should be calculated in real-time without blocking the UI\n- **Optimized Storage**: Use efficient data structures for storing fuel entry history with proper indexing\n\n### Security\n- **Data Validation**: All fuel entry inputs must be validated for type, range, and business rules\n- **Input Sanitization**: Prevent SQL injection and XSS in all fuel-related data operations\n- **Data Integrity**: Ensure fuel entry consistency with vehicle odometer readings and prevent duplicate entries\n\n### Reliability\n- **Data Persistence**: All fuel entries must be reliably stored with automatic backup capability\n- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of network failures, storage errors, or invalid data states\n- **Offline Support**: Basic fuel entry viewing should work offline with sync capabilities\n\n### Usability\n- **Intuitive Navigation**: Clear path between fuel entry, viewing, and analytics functions\n- **Mobile Optimization**: Touch-friendly interface optimized for mobile device usage\n- **Accessibility**: Support for screen readers and other accessibility tools\n- **Visual Feedback**: Clear indication of loading states, validation errors, and successful operations",
