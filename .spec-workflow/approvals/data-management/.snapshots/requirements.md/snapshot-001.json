Currently, the app displays hardcoded dummy data and has non-functional UI elements. This implementation will enable users to add, edit, and view vehicle data, fuel entries, and service records through a simple, robust data management system while ensuring all icons display properly and don't cause crashes.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis feature supports the myVenti app's core mission of providing a comprehensive vehicle management solution by:\n- Enabling users to actively manage their vehicle data rather than just viewing static content\n- Ensuring a stable, crash-free user experience through proper icon handling\n- Following KISS, DRY, and YAGNI principles to maintain code simplicity and maintainability\n- Creating a foundation for future real data integration\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to add new vehicles to my fleet through a simple form, so that I can track all my vehicles in one place.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user taps \"Add Vehicle\" button THEN system SHALL display a vehicle creation form with fields for vehicle name, year, make, model, and type\n2. WHEN user fills required fields and submits THEN system SHALL validate input and add vehicle to the local data store\n3. WHEN vehicle is added successfully THEN system SHALL return to vehicle list and show new vehicle in the list\n4. WHEN user taps cancel THEN system SHALL return to vehicle list without saving\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to add fuel entries for my vehicles, so that I can track fuel consumption and expenses over time.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user taps \"Add Fuel Entry\" button THEN system SHALL display fuel entry form with vehicle selector, date, amount, gallons/gallons, and mileage fields\n2. WHEN user selects vehicle and fills required fields THEN system SHALL validate data and save fuel entry\n3. WHEN fuel entry is saved THEN system SHALL update the fuel list and monthly summary statistics\n4. WHEN entering fuel for electric vehicles THEN system SHALL allow kWh instead of gallons and mark as \"Electric\"\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want to add service records for my vehicles, so that I can track maintenance history and upcoming service needs.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user accesses service screen THEN system SHALL display \"Add Service Record\" button\n2. WHEN user taps \"Add Service Record\" THEN system SHALL show form with vehicle selector, service type, date, cost, and notes fields\n3. WHEN service record is added THEN system SHALL update service list and upcoming service indicators\n4. WHEN service date approaches THEN system SHALL highlight upcoming services in dashboard\n\n### Requirement 4\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want all icons in the app to display properly without causing crashes, so that I can have a stable user experience.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN app loads THEN system SHALL verify all IconSymbol names are valid and available\n2. WHEN icon is not available THEN system SHALL fallback to alternative icon or hide gracefully\n3. WHEN icon size is too large for container THEN system SHALL scale appropriately or use responsive sizing\n4. WHEN icon component fails THEN system SHALL not crash the entire screen/component\n\n### Requirement 5\n\n**User Story:** As a user, I want to view and edit existing data entries, so that I can keep my vehicle information accurate and up-to-date.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN user long-presses on vehicle/fuel/service item THEN system SHALL show edit/delete options\n2. WHEN user chooses edit THEN system SHALL populate form with existing data for modification\n3. WHEN user deletes item THEN system SHALL show confirmation dialog and remove item upon confirmation\n4. WHEN data is modified THEN system SHALL update all related summary statistics and displays\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each data management component shall handle one specific data type (vehicles, fuel, service)\n- **Modular Design**: Data store, forms, and validation shall be separated into distinct, reusable modules\n- **Dependency Management**: Minimize coupling between data types while maintaining data consistency\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean contracts between data store, UI components, and validation logic\n\n### Performance\n- Forms shall render and respond to user input within 100ms on typical devices\n- Data operations shall complete within 50ms for datasets up to 1000 items\n- Icon fallback mechanisms shall resolve within 10ms to prevent UI lag\n\n### Security\n- Input validation shall sanitize all user data to prevent injection attacks\n- Local data storage shall use React Native's secure storage patterns for sensitive information\n\n### Reliability\n- Data validation shall prevent invalid state transitions\n- Icon loading failures shall not crash the application\n- Data integrity shall be maintained through proper validation and error handling\n\n### Usability\n- Forms shall follow platform-specific input patterns (iOS keyboard, Android material)\n- Error messages shall be clear, actionable, and contextually relevant\n- Icons shall be sized appropriately for their containers and use consistent sizing patterns",
