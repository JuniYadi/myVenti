The app will feature a bottom navigation bar with five main sections (Home, Vehicle, Fuel, Service, Settings) and a distinctive circular home button positioned in the center of the navigation bar. The design will follow current 2025 mobile UI/UX trends with emphasis on clean aesthetics, intuitive navigation, and optimal user experience for vehicle data management.\n\n## Alignment with Product Vision\n\nThis modern layout design supports MyVenti's goal of providing an intuitive and visually appealing vehicle tracking solution. The bottom navigation with central circular home button creates a distinctive brand identity while improving accessibility to core features. The minimalistic approach reduces cognitive load, allowing users to focus on what matters most - managing their vehicle data efficiently.\n\n## Requirements\n\n### Requirement 1\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want a modern bottom navigation bar with clear access to all main sections, so that I can quickly navigate between different parts of the app.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the app loads THEN the system SHALL display a bottom navigation bar with five sections: Home, Vehicle, Fuel, Service, Settings\n2. WHEN the user taps any navigation item THEN the system SHALL navigate to the corresponding section\n3. WHEN on a section THEN the system SHALL visually indicate the active section with highlighting or color change\n4. WHEN the user navigates THEN the system SHALL provide smooth transition animations\n\n### Requirement 2\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want a distinctive circular home button in the center of the navigation bar, so that I can easily return to the home screen from anywhere in the app.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the navigation bar renders THEN the system SHALL display a circular home button positioned in the center\n2. WHEN the user taps the circular home button THEN the system SHALL navigate to the home screen\n3. WHEN the home button is displayed THEN it SHALL be visually distinct from other navigation items\n4. WHEN the home screen is active THEN the circular button SHALL be highlighted or show active state\n\n### Requirement 3\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want a minimalistic and modern design aesthetic, so that the app feels current and professional.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN viewing any screen THEN the system SHALL use a consistent color palette with primary, secondary, and accent colors\n2. WHEN displaying UI elements THEN the system SHALL use rounded corners and smooth shadows following 2025 design trends\n3. WHEN rendering text THEN the system SHALL use modern, clean typography with proper hierarchy\n4. WHEN showing icons THEN the system SHALL use consistent, modern iconography throughout the app\n\n### Requirement 4\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want the home screen to serve as a central dashboard, so that I can quickly see key information about my vehicles.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN on the home screen THEN the system SHALL display a summary of vehicle information\n2. WHEN viewing the home screen THEN the system SHALL show quick access cards for recent fuel entries and service records\n3. WHEN on the home dashboard THEN the system SHALL display key metrics like total vehicles, last service date, fuel consumption summary\n4. WHEN interacting with home screen elements THEN the system SHALL provide navigation to detailed sections\n\n### Requirement 5\n\n**User Story:** As a vehicle owner, I want responsive design that works across different device sizes, so that I can use the app on various mobile devices.\n\n#### Acceptance Criteria\n\n1. WHEN the app loads on different screen sizes THEN the system SHALL adapt the layout appropriately\n2. WHEN viewing on smaller screens THEN the system SHALL maintain readability and usability\n3. WHEN on larger screens THEN the system SHALL utilize available space effectively\n4. WHEN rotating the device THEN the system SHALL maintain proper layout and functionality\n\n## Non-Functional Requirements\n\n### Code Architecture and Modularity\n- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each component file should handle one specific UI element or screen\n- **Modular Design**: Navigation, layout components, and screen components should be separate and reusable\n- **Dependency Management**: Navigation logic should be separated from UI components\n- **Clear Interfaces**: Define clean props contracts between navigation and screen components\n\n### Performance\n- **Navigation Speed**: Screen transitions should complete within 200ms\n- **Memory Usage**: The navigation bar should maintain minimal memory footprint\n- **Startup Time**: App should display navigation within 1 second of launch\n- **Animation Performance**: All animations should maintain 60fps on target devices\n\n### Security\n- **Data Protection**: User vehicle data should be properly secured in local storage\n- **Navigation Security**: Routes should be protected against unauthorized access\n- **Input Validation**: All user inputs should be validated before processing\n\n### Reliability\n- **Crash Prevention**: Navigation should handle edge cases gracefully without crashing\n- **State Consistency**: Navigation state should remain consistent across app lifecycle events\n- **Error Handling**: Navigation errors should provide user-friendly feedback\n\n### Usability\n- **Accessibility**: Navigation should support screen readers and other accessibility tools\n- **Touch Targets**: All navigation elements should meet minimum touch target size (44x44 points)\n- **Visual Feedback**: All interactive elements should provide clear visual feedback\n- **Intuitive Design**: Navigation should follow established mobile app conventions",
